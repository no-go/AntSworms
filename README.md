# RobugSworms

Ha! It is a typo but itis cool. This is a swarm simulator for
robot bugs, ants and maybe other robots or insects).

## Still pre alpha state

In the future this simulates massive robot szenarios and log their events.

## Hints

- fltk as gui
- c++11 code
- Makefile with unixodie operating system

## todo

- grandle or maven
- better class names
- add alpha as color
- code split into h, hpp, cpp and use extern as force against include loops and usage loops
- some code parts should be in world and not in the robug class
