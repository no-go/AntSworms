Molecular machines, optical digital processing units and analogue computers
with a pneumatic logical unit are able to work in special environments, where
modern micro controllers are too large, use too much electric energy or are
not resistant to massive electromagnetic forces. Many of these techniques are
unable to use wireless communication, unable to store big data sizes or
do millions instructions of a complex algorithm.
If you want to solve a big problem with it, you have to solve it in a 
collective opportunistic way with a simple logic for each unit. We concentrated
on the ant algorithm to find and collect food. This algorithm use pheromones
and the environment to control and communicate to each unit (ant). We found out,
that simulating a simple implementation of this algorithm leads to ant mills and
high frequented routes to empty food areas. In contrast to bees, the
simulated ants did not split into a searching and a collecting behavior in
that case. In this paper we present a small modification of the ant
algorithm to protect a swarm from collective misconduct. We show, how
successful this modification is and compare this concept to
nature and other ant algorithm simulations.
