The technological development is often motivated by nature concepts.
For example molecular machines with a minimal logic acting like complex biological
proteins. We are thinking ahead: these molecular machines will work as a robot
swarm in the future. Therefore we need a simple logic for each machine.
We concentrated on the ant algorithm to find and collect food. This algorithm use
pheromones and the environment to control and communicate to each machine (ant).
We found out, that simulating a simple implementation of this algorithm leads
to ant mills and high frequented routes to empty food areas. In this paper 
we present a small modification of the ant
algorithm to protect a swarm from collective misconduct. We show, how
successful this modification is and compare this concept to
nature and other ant algorithm simulations.
