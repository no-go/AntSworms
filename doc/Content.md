From IEEE:

A conference article or paper should have the following elements:
 Metadata: title, keywords, abstract, professional affiliation(s), and cited references in
    the bibliography must be included, and written in the English Language.

 Abstract: a brief and objective summary that previews the rest of the paper it describes.
    It should be succinct yet provide enough information about the paper to facilitate a
    decision on whether the entire paper could be read with profit.

 Introduction: an introductory statement of the purpose of the paper, usually describing
    the hypothesis that will be tested and a summary of related previous work by others.

 Methods: the methods that are used to test the hypothesis should be given in sufficient
    detail that another researcher in the field could duplicate the testing.

 Results: the hypothesis should be tested and data representing the results of the testing
    presented.

 Conclusion: the data should be discussed and the results interpreted, and conclusions 
    given.

Building robots in hardware to test a swarm algorithm is possible, but
expensive [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_robotic_platforms)

A hardware specific simulation of a single device exists, too:

## Bee algorithm

1.  Ein kleiner teil der Bienen (Scouts) sucht global nach "gärten"
2.  Da Gärten, wo es viel "Futter" gibt ein großes Areal sind, kommen viele Scouts
    zum dance-floor zurück mit ähnlichen Koordinaten
3.  normale Bienen folgen nun den Scouts und verbreiten sich im Areal (Nahsuche)
4.  ein Teil fliegt als Scout weiter und sucht neue Gärten
5.  durch die Nahsuche werden schlechte Regionen von den Bienen ausgeschlossen
    und bessere Regionen "gespeichert"
6.  Biene, die bessere Region fand, wird neuer Scout und fliegt zum dance floor
7.  Biene, die in der Region keine Verbesserung nach einer Weile fand, sucht neue Gärten
