From IEEE:

A conference article or paper should have the following elements:
 Metadata: title, keywords, abstract, professional affiliation(s), and cited references in
    the bibliography must be included, and written in the English Language.

 Abstract: a brief and objective summary that previews the rest of the paper it describes.
    It should be succinct yet provide enough information about the paper to facilitate a
    decision on whether the entire paper could be read with profit.

 Introduction: an introductory statement of the purpose of the paper, usually describing
    the hypothesis that will be tested and a summary of related previous work by others.

 Methods: the methods that are used to test the hypothesis should be given in sufficient
    detail that another researcher in the field could duplicate the testing.

 Results: the hypothesis should be tested and data representing the results of the testing
    presented.

 Conclusion: the data should be discussed and the results interpreted, and conclusions 
    given.
